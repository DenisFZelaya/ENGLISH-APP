The error you're encountering (EACCES error) typically indicates a permissions issue while trying to execute the ./gradlew script. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

Check Permissions:
Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts in the project directory. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x android/gradlew
This command makes the gradlew script executable. After running this command, try building your project again.

Run as Administrator/Superuser:
If you're on a Unix-based system (Linux or macOS), try running the build command with sudo:


sudo npx react-native run-android


Clean Gradle:
Sometimes, issues with Gradle builds can be resolved by cleaning the Gradle cache. Run the following commands in your project's android directory:

bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
After cleaning, go back to your project directory and try running the build again.

Update Gradle:
Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Gradle. Check the android/build.gradle file in your project and update the gradle version if necessary. You can find the latest version on the Gradle website.

gradle
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:YOUR_VERSION'
Replace YOUR_VERSION with the desired Gradle version.

Check Environment Variables:
Make sure that your PATH environment variable includes the necessary paths for Android development. Verify that the Android SDK and Gradle paths are correctly set.

Reinstall Dependencies:
Delete the node_modules directory and reinstall dependencies:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
After reinstalling dependencies, try building your project again.

Update npm Packages:
Ensure that your react-native and related packages are up-to-date. Run the following commands:

bash
npm install -g react-native@latest
npm install
Then, try building your project again.


rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/
